-- EASY --
Send the floating window info to its statusbar, not the main statusbar
Fix the background issues on QTableWidgets
Add a button to explain the shortcuts
Add a 2nd deep level for lists
-- MEDIUM --
Fix the copy to clipboard not copying the formats and colors (ToHTML, ToMarkdown and ToPlainText do not do that)
Complete the Private Notes Tab
Complete the TasksToDoTab
Make the shortcuts or the Formatting Editor in the main window available for all notes
Set a minimum size for each note, both width and height (with too many, on vertical mode they are just tiny)
Make possible to resize/move the grid splitters (add splitters)
Maybe have Templates in notes?
-- HARD --
Auto-correct text in multiple languages, or suggestions if a word is badly written
IA capabilities, read your notes and transform them with a custom prompt using an LLM?
Deploy this as an .exe file
