-- EASY --
Set shortcuts for the WISIWYG editor once implemented
Add two rows of Toolbar, to categorize buttons and add more customs, or a QGridLayout
Add statusbar to QDialog, to specify when a button fails (if selected, if text is not selected, etc)
-- MEDIUM --
minimum size for each note, both width and height (with too many, on vertical mode they are just tiny)
Make possible to resize/move the grid splitters (add splitters)
Maybe Templates in notes?
-- HARD --
IA capabilities, read your notes and transform them with a custom prompt.
