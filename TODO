-- EASY --
Send the floating window info to its statusbar, not the main statusbar
Add a button to explain the shortcuts
Add a 2nd deep level for lists
Add a Diffuminated layer for private notes
-- MEDIUM --
Add a new Order column in the database for the notes, to make them orderable, as a small number field on the corner, to reload.
Fix the copy to clipboard not copying the formats and colors (ToHTML, ToMarkdown and ToPlainText do not do that)
Complete the TasksToDoTab
Add a "Find" button, to find a substring among all notes, like a global Search.
Make the shortcuts or the Formatting Editor in the main window available for all notes
Set a minimum size for each note, both width and height (with too many, on vertical mode they are just tiny)
Make possible to resize/move the grid splitters (add splitters)
Maybe have Templates in notes?
Make possible add images to the notes (how do we store that into the DB?)
-- HARD --
Compile to exe, or add an auto-installer
Auto-correct text in multiple languages, or suggestions if a word is badly written
IA capabilities, read your notes and transform them with a custom prompt using an LLM?
Deploy this as an .exe file

-- BUGS --
Fix that it remembers the screen where the program is. By default it always opens on main screen even if you have 3.
Fix unability to paste code from Win + V
Fix the background issues on QTableWidgets
Find a better way to save the Notes and Title of notes. As "OnLeave" misses some scenarios
    Example: When you enter the field, click on it, move mouse out and then start writing. As mouse was already out, it won't save.
