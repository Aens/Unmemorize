-- EASY --
Button to add a timestamp into the text, where the cursor is.
Remove all formatting button
Set shortcuts for the WISIWYG editor once implemented
-- MEDIUM --
minimum size for each note, both width and height (with too many, on vertical mode they are just tiny)
Make possible to resize/move the grid splitters (add splitters)
Maybe Templates in notes?
-- HARD --
IA capabilities, read your notes and transform them with a custom prompt.
